A heat exchanger is a ubiquitous device used in many applications: pharmaceuticals, pasteurization, regeneration, automobiles, power plants, etc. It takes a hot fluid and a cold fluid and runs them in parallel or counterflow to raise the temperature of the cold fluid and lower the temperature of the hot fluid all without the fluids mixing. 

I decided to analyze a heat exchanger to determine how long the interior tubing may be based on the inlet and outlet temperatures of the hot and cold fluids.

**The Setup**
Counterflow

Parallel

The basic values: 
- **Counterflow**
- Hot Water In: 42.5 degrees C
- Cold Water In: 7.0 degrees C
- Hot Water Out: 23.7 degrees C
- Cold Water Out: 24.4 degrees C

- **Parallel Flow**
- Hot Water In: 35.4 degrees C
- Cold Water In: 5.2 degrees C
- Hot Water Out: 19.8 degrees C
- Cold Water Out: 16.4 degrees C

With these values and a few properties of the fluid, I was able to figure out how much heat transfer occurred and also how long the tubes inside the heat exchanger are.
