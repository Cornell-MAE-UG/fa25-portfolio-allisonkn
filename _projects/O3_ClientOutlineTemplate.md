# Your Project Title

**Team:** Team Lighthouse
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E\&J Gallo Winery / National Grape  

## Problem statement (most important)

Spotted lantern flies gather on grape vines, but they also gather on other plants that we don’t harvest, like the Tree of Heaven. How can we leverage this unique quality and lure spotted lantern flies to specific locations away from the vineyards to be exterminated?  

## Impact
Spotted lantern flies have been an invasive species and have destroyed hundreds of grape harvests. If we can limit their destruction, we can save farmers thousands of dollars and reduce food waste. 

## Proposed direction(s)

### Concept A (primary): Decoy Tree-Like Structure

**What it is:** A tall structure made to attract SLF due to its size and stature. Includes a fumigator that sends out poisonous, yet attractive, scents and chemicals.  
**How it would be used:** The SLFs would be attracted to this decoy tree like it is to the Tree of Heaven. It would ingest its poisonous chemicals and either die immediately or bring back this harmful substance to the remainder of its population.  
**Why it’s better than the status quo:** This decoy tree can target specific areas near grape harvests and pull SLFs away from the vines and towards a centralized location where they can easily be killed all at once. 
**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:** We can build the fumigator attachment that will be added to tall poles, and we can design a linkage that can attach to a standard pole or tree.

### Concepts B, C, etc.

<Only include if you want the client to compare two directions. Keep short.>

## Key risks / unknowns

- SLFs might invade the lured regions and become a problem in a different industry/environment
- Requires more manpower to kill when they’re trapped and need to be extracted
- Each lure/trap will need to be maintained since they can’t hold infinite amounts of SLFs.
- Don’t know how attracted they will be to grapes vs. chemicals/ decoy
- It will take research to see if and how effective a lure actually is since we don’t know how strongly they would value the lures over grapes.
- Catching other bugs/animals
- The pheromones and chemicals might attract different insects/animals and so if we implement an insecticide to kill the SLFs, then we might hurt other species unnecessarily.


## Questions for the client
Focus on questions they can answer from lived experience.
1. How would you rank the effectiveness of each luring factor we have in our idea (electric frequency, scent of organic compounds, honeydew, scent)?
2. What are different bugs that may be affected by catching spotted lanternflies and what are things we can do to prevent this?
