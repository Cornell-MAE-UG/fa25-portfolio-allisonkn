I've been designing, manufacturing, and testing a tilt rotor mechanism for my project team CUAir to transition between horizontal and vertical flight. 

**Motors: MAD V62 PRO Feathering propeller Autocenter eVTOL Drone Motor**

I began the project by selecting motors capable of providing enough thrust for takeoff (70lbf) while still enabling weight reduction from our previous aircraft models (55lbs to 35lbs). While choosing motors, I also had to ensure that the associated propellers' diameter was small enough to not induce a large gyroscopic moment. 

**Mechanism: 1.6 Ratio Gear Train with Al5052 Clevis and HiTec Servo**

I designed the mechanism to be actuated by the D955TW Servo from HiTec.
