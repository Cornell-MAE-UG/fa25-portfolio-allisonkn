My group dissected a vacuum cleaner to determine the net suction force. We determined the pressure difference created by the radial pump and then used this to determine the force by utilizing the filter area. My contribution included disassembling the motor and pump housing, as well as the pump itself. I performed analysis on the fluid flow path and motor parameters like the speed and power. Attached is a video summary of our dissection.
